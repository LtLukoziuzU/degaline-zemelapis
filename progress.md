# Project Progress

## Completed

### Step 1 — xlsx inspection
Downloaded today's file (`dk-2026-04-09.xlsx`) and confirmed column structure. Header row detected dynamically by scanning for `'Data'` in column A (row number varies between files). Confirmed 7-column wide format: date, company, municipality, address, 95 petrol, diesel, LPG. LPG/price cells can be float or string `'neprekiauja'`. Yesterday's file used a different 6-column long format — treating today's wide format as the standard going forward.

### Step 2 — minimal index.html with SheetJS parsing
Built first version of `index.html` with a file input, SheetJS (bundled at `lib/xlsx.full.min.js`), dynamic header detection, and on-screen display of parsed rows. Verified correct parsing of `latest.xlsx`.

### Step 3 — Leaflet map with test markers
Added full-screen Leaflet map (bundled at `lib/leaflet/`) centred on Lithuania with 5 hardcoded test markers and sample popups. Switched tile provider from OSM default to CartoDB Voyager — OSM blocks `file://` requests due to missing Referer header. Dark toolbar overlay with file picker and status text.

### Step 4 — local HTTP server + unified geocache
Scrapped the File System Access API / IndexedDB dual-backend approach. Instead, `update.bat` and `update.sh` now start a local HTTP server (`server.ps1` on Windows via PowerShell, `server.py` on Linux via Python 3) on port 58472, then open the browser to `http://localhost:58472`. The server serves static files and accepts `POST /data/geocache.json` to write the cache to disk. All browsers use identical `fetch()` calls — no browser-specific code. Verified: 714 stations parsed, geocache loaded, server running on fresh launch.

### Step 5 — Live geocoding
Switched from Nominatim to Photon (komoot.io) — better handling of Lithuanian addresses, no API key required. Geocache built for all 713 stations. 23 addresses required manual coordinate lookup (municipality fallbacks and wrong-country results); saved to `data/manual-geocache-addresses.md`. `Duomenys:` stray row marked as `source: "failed"` to prevent geocoding.

### Step 6 — Full data pipeline + markers
All 713 stations placed as Leaflet markers. Stations sharing identical coordinates combined into one popup. Popup shows company, address, and non-null prices. Map bounds restricted to prevent panning far outside Lithuania.

### Step 7 — `update.bat` and `update.sh`
Both scripts written and verified. No changes needed after Steps 5–6.

### Step 8 (partial) — UI polish
1. Attribution/licensing text for LEA data source in UI + company list generated dynamically from xlsx ✓
2. Marker clustering for dense areas (e.g. Vilnius) ✓
3. Marker colours by company — SVG teardrop pins, each company gets a distinct hex color derived from their brand, small operators (≤3 stations) share grey. Color map in `COMPANY_COLORS` in `index.html`, reference colors in `data/company-colors.txt` ✓
4. Marker popup styling ✓
5. Persist last map position and zoom level in localStorage (restore on next load) ✓

### Step 9 — GitHub migration + hosted deployment
Project moved to a public GitHub repo (`LtLukoziuzU/degaline-zemelapis`). Hosted on GitHub Pages at `https://ltlukoziuzu.github.io/degaline-zemelapis/`.

- `pipeline.py` — server-side script replacing browser-side xlsx parsing and geocoding. Downloads xlsx, parses with openpyxl, geocodes new addresses via Photon, writes `data/stations.json` and updates `data/geocache.json`. Also diffs against previous data and writes daily change logs to `data/logs/` and snapshots to `data/history/`.
- `index.html` rewritten — removed SheetJS, geocoding, and local server dependency. Now simply fetches `data/stations.json` and renders markers.
- `.github/workflows/update.yml` — daily GitHub Actions workflow at 07:00 UTC: runs `pipeline.py`, commits updated data, deploys to Pages. Sends email notification (via Gmail SMTP) when new, removed, or geocoding-changed stations are detected.
- Geocache normalised to stripped address keys (trailing spaces from SheetJS removed).

See [plan-github-migration.md](plan-github-migration.md) for full migration plan.

### Step 10 — Dev verification tool (`dev.html`)

A developer-only page for manually verifying station geocoordinates.

- `dev.html` — same map as `index.html` but with "Teisinga / Neteisinga" buttons in each popup. Marker inner circle turns green/red to reflect per-station verdict. "Kita netikrinta →" toolbar button cycles through unverified groups in order, panning and zooming to each.
- `data/verifications.json` — stores verification state: `"company|||address"` → `"correct" | "incorrect"`. Tracked in git; absent key = unchecked.
- **Save mechanism:** on localhost, POSTs to `server.py` (which now also accepts `POST /data/verifications.json`). On GitHub Pages, PUTs via GitHub Contents API using a fine-grained PAT stored in localStorage. PAT prompt shown on first load; `🔑` toolbar button to update/clear it.
- **CI deploy on push:** `update.yml` now also triggers on `push` to main. `update-data` job is skipped on push events; `deploy` job runs regardless, so any commit to main deploys immediately.
- Verification work is ongoing / deferred to a later date.

### Step 11 — Mobile-first redesign

- `viewport-fit=cover` added for iOS notch / Android edge-to-edge safe area support
- Toolbar restructured to `flex-direction: column` with `.toolbar-main` inner row; ready for additional rows (search already added below)
- Buttons enlarged to `2.5rem` (40px) for proper touch targets
- `ResizeObserver` on `#toolbar` writes `--toolbar-height` CSS var; map `top` tracks it dynamically — toolbar can grow without manual adjustment
- Map `bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0)` for iOS home indicator / Android gesture bar
- `env(safe-area-inset-top)` padding on `.toolbar-main` for notch devices
- Status text truncates with ellipsis on narrow screens

### Step 12 (partial) — Search bar

- `.toolbar-search` row added inside `#toolbar` below `.toolbar-main`; `--toolbar-height` auto-adjusts map
- Full-width input with clear (✕) button; `input.blur()` on selection dismisses Android keyboard
- Dropdown (`#search-dropdown`) positioned `fixed` at `top: var(--toolbar-height)`, overlays the map
- Searches company + address + municipality; query split into words, all must match (supports "Circle K Šiauliai")
- Up to 8 results; each shows company bold + address/municipality
- Selecting a result: clears input, blurs, calls `cluster.zoomToShowLayer()` then opens popup
- Keyboard: ↑↓ navigate, Enter select, Esc dismiss
- `mousedown` + `e.preventDefault()` on results prevents blur-before-click race

### Step 13 — Pipeline reliability + versioning

- **Build SHA** stamped into `index.html` at deploy time (`__BUILD_SHA__` → short git commit SHA); shown in about dialog under "Versija:".
- **Data timestamp** (`fetched_at`) written to `stations.json` by `pipeline.py` (UTC ISO with `+00:00` suffix); stamped into `index.html` at deploy as "Naujausi duomenys gauti: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM" (Vilnius timezone). The `+00:00` suffix is required so `TZ=Europe/Vilnius date -d` correctly converts from UTC rather than treating the value as already-Vilnius time.
- **Date removed from toolbar** status — now shows only station count.
- **Workflow cron changed** from daily 07:00 UTC to every 15 minutes Mon–Fri 06:00–14:45 UTC (≈ 08:00–17:00 Vilnius time), to catch LEA publishing at an unpredictable time during the workday.
- **Early-exit pipeline logic removed** — all date-based skips dropped. ENA edits the SharePoint file live throughout the day (and potentially after the last cron tick), so every run re-downloads and re-processes whatever is currently in the file, regardless of its date. The git commit step skips committing if `stations.json` is byte-for-byte unchanged on disk.
- **Referer header** added to xlsx download requests to mimic a browser referral from `ena.lt/degalu-kainos-degalinese/`.
- **Download diagnosis** — confirmed download failures are timing-only (file not yet published by LEA at time of run); CDN is Cloudflare LAX, no geographic IP block. Pipeline catches the file on a later cron tick once LEA publishes.
- **`getCompanyColor()` helper** — franchise stations named "Foo (Circle K)" automatically inherit the parent brand's color via regex suffix match; used for all marker and panel color lookups.

### Step 12 (remaining) — UI polish

- **Address preprocessing for `/` double-street format:** `pipeline.py` now strips the secondary street reference (e.g. `Beržų g. 24/Drąsiųjų 7` → `Beržų g. 24`) before querying Photon. Cache key remains the original address string.
- **Browser error handling:** no action needed — geocoding is server-side only; all realistic browser failure paths (`file://`, fetch failure) already show friendly Lithuanian UI errors.

### Step 14 — Cheapest in radius

- **🎯 toolbar button** enters pick mode — crosshair cursor on desktop, floating hint banner on mobile ("Bakstelėkite vietą žemėlapyje"), button highlights blue
- **Map click** drops a non-clustered crosshair marker at the tapped point and opens the results panel
- **"📍 Rasti pigesnes netoliese"** button injected into every station popup — uses that station as center with company-first rule (same-company cheapest shown first with ⭐ tag, no medals in this mode; plain radius search uses 🥇🥈🥉); price tiebreak by distance
- **Results panel** — bottom sheet on mobile, floating card bottom-right on desktop (media query `pointer: fine` + `min-width: 600px`)
  - Fuel type pills (95 / Dyzelis / Dujos), default 95, persisted in localStorage
  - Radius slider 1–50 km (resets to 5 km on each new center — see Step 16)
  - "Rodyti tikrinamą plotą žemėlapyje" checkbox — toggles dashed filled radius circle on map
  - 3 result rows: colored dot, company, address, distance, price; click zooms to station and opens popup
  - 🎯 reposition button inside panel to re-enter pick mode without closing
  - ✕ closes and cleans up all map overlays; Escape key also closes on desktop
- **1.75× oversized non-clustered markers** placed directly on map for the 3 result stations — always visible regardless of zoom/clustering; clicking them opens the station popup
- **Collapsible panel on mobile** — tapping anywhere on the header bar (except ✕) collapses/expands the controls and results; chevron indicator (▾/▸) hidden on desktop
- **Bug fix:** collapse click handler now checks `getComputedStyle` on `#rp-chevron` — no-ops on desktop where chevron is `display:none`
- **Bug fix:** map click in pick mode now always passes `null` as `fromStation` — manual repositioning always produces generic top-3, never company-biased results

### Step 16 — GPS locate-me button + radius UX polish

- **📍 locate-me button** — fixed bottom-left corner, circular, accent-coloured; visually distinct from all other controls
  - Tries `navigator.geolocation` first (GPS, zoom 14, no toast); on any failure falls back to `ipwho.is` was tried but requires paid CORS plan → switched to **`ipinfo.io`** (free, HTTPS, CORS, 50k req/month); parses `loc` field (`"lat,lng"` string)
  - IP fallback zooms to 11 and shows toast "Apytikslė vieta (pagal IP adresą.)"
  - Spinner SVG shown while waiting; button re-enables on success or error
  - Button always present (ipinfo.io fallback means even browsers without Geolocation API benefit)
- **Mobile panel-push** — button slides up by `panel.offsetHeight + 12px` whenever panel has `open` class (covers both expanded and collapsed-header states); desktop unaffected; `syncLocateBtn()` called after source tag appears to account for its added height
- **Mobile centering fix** — projects `latlng` to pixel space, shifts south by `panel.offsetHeight / 2`, unprojects back to `setView` target; avoids the animation-override bug of the earlier `panBy` approach
- **Radius resets to 5 km** on every new center pick (map click, popup button, or locate-me); localStorage persistence for radius removed — user decides each time
- **Medal fixes:**
  - Locate-me was getting no medals (bug: `fromStation = 'gps'` is truthy); fixed by checking `typeof fromStation === 'object'`
  - Station-popup mode now shows 🥇🥈 for positions 2 and 3 (same-company first result keeps its ⭐ tag, no medal)
- **Source tag** — thin muted line between panel header and controls; always shown when panel is open:
  - Map click → "Pagal pasirinktą tašką"
  - Popup button → "Pagal pasirinktą degalinę"
  - Locate GPS → "Tiksli vieta (GPS)"
  - Locate IP → "Apytikslė vieta (pagal IP adresą)"
  - Hidden when panel is collapsed; cleared on each new center pick then overridden by source
- **Icon consistency** — toolbar radius button and in-panel reposition button now use the same pin+arcs SVG; locate-me uses GPS crosshair SVG; all three are visually distinct to first-time visitors
- **Mobile close UX** — ✕ button gets larger padding/font on touch screens; reposition button pushed left with `margin-right` to avoid accidental close taps
- **Small operator pin color** changed from mid-grey `#9ca3af` to dark near-black `#3d3d3d` — visible on light tiles, neutral grey (no blue cast) keeps it distinct from Skulas (`#1f2937`)
- **Locate-me button** hardcoded to `#2563eb` instead of `var(--accent)` — stays vivid blue in dark mode where accent fades to `#89b4fa`

### Step 15 — Dark mode tile filter

- CSS `filter` applied to `.leaflet-tile-pane` in `html.dark`: `brightness(0.65) saturate(0.6) hue-rotate(190deg) contrast(1.1)`
- Dims and desaturates Voyager tiles, then hue-rotates warm beige/green tones toward cool blue-grey — similar feel to Google Maps dark mode
- No tile URL change, no API key, works offline; one CSS rule

### Step 17 — Licensing, theme detection, about dialog polish

- **MIT License** added (`LICENSE` file in repo root); GitHub auto-detected and displays it in the repo sidebar.
- **System theme detection** — first-time visitors no longer default to dark mode unconditionally; `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` is used when no `degaline-theme` key exists in localStorage. Returning visitors still get their last manually chosen theme.
- **Geocoding accuracy note** added to the about dialog — explains that coordinates are Photon-generated and may occasionally be imprecise; notes the verification tool exists to address this over time.
- **Company list collapsed by default** — the list of gas station networks in the about dialog is now hidden under a `<details>`/`<summary>` spoiler block to reduce visual noise on open.

### Step 18 — Search persistence, share link, and related fixes

- **Last search persisted in localStorage** (`degaline-search`: lat, lng, radiusKm, source) — restored automatically on next visit with the same radius and source context. Cleared when user explicitly closes the panel with ✕, so only "left-open" searches are restored.
- **Share link button** (chain icon, `#rp-share`) added to panel header — copies a URL with `?lat=…&lng=…&r=…&z=…&f=…` to clipboard via `navigator.clipboard`; shows "Nuoroda nukopijuota!" toast on success (reuses `#locate-toast`).
  - Fuel type encoded as short aliases: `95` / `dyz` / `snd` (receiving end also accepts `lpg` → LPG).
  - On open: URL params take priority over localStorage saved search; lat/lng snapped to nearest station within 30 m → station-based search with correct company-first medals; params stripped from address bar via `history.replaceState` after apply.
  - Mobile centering fix applied — `requestAnimationFrame` defers `map.setView` with panel-offset adjustment to after the browser's first layout pass (panel height is 0 during synchronous init).
- **Panel button spacing fixed on mobile** — `margin-right` moved from `#rp-reposition` to `margin-left` on `#rp-share`; all three icon buttons now have uniform gaps.
- **Geocache collision investigated** — `Gegužių g. 28, Šiauliai` (Neste) and `Gegužių g. 28` (Plovimo sistemos) share coordinates; confirmed intentional (two separate businesses at the same address). No action taken.

### Step 19 — Company logo processing for custom map pins

- Sourced logo images for all companies into `originallogo/` (gitignored). Photo-based logos (real-world station photos) scrapped — those companies fall back to default pin.
- `process_logos.py` — resizes and crops each logo to a 256×256 circle PNG with transparent exterior; no color changes.
- `make_circleextend.py` — detects each logo's background color and fills the full circle with it, removing artifact black corners left by the putalpha approach. Auto-detection worked for ~24 of 34 logos; 10 required manual fixing (black text removal issues, color quantization mismatches, transparent-bg logos).
- Final output in `goodlogo/` — one `{company}.png` per company, ready for use as map pins.
- Full strategy, decisions, and manual fix log documented in [logo-processing.md](logo-processing.md).

### Step 20 — Company logo map pins and UI integration

- Teardrop pins replaced with logo-embedded teardrops: white disk (r=8 in 24-unit viewBox) behind each logo so light/white content reads regardless of teardrop color. No-logo companies keep the plain teardrop with white semi-transparent circle. Old teardrop code retained for easy revert.
- `LOGO_MAP` in `index.html` maps company name strings to `goodlogo/` filenames; Circle K franchisees matched via `/circle\s*k/i` regex.
- Plovimo sistemos has no logo (shares address with Neste); grouped pins prefer the first logo-having company in the group regardless of data order.
- Pin size: 36×54 px normal (3:4 ratio, logo ~40px); result panel markers same size but not clustered.
- Company logo shown in station popup (above name) and in radius panel result rows (2.8rem square, between medal and text).
- Post-processing fixes to `goodlogo/`: emsi/pynauja/stateta transparent interiors → white; melkasta black background → white; jozita/naftrus/neste/RV/utentra marks expanded and re-centered; circlek/orlen/viada marks expanded (red border preserved for CK/Viada); orlen nudged up 12px to compensate for text-heavy bottom.
- Cluster radii tightened: zoom ≤10 → 70px, 11–13 → 60px, ≥14 → 40px.
- Attribution note added to company list spoiler in about dialog: "Įmonių logotipai paimti iš viešai prieinamų duomenų."

### Step 21 — Pin location audit and mass correction

- **`check_pins.py`** — new script that compares each station's coordinates against its declared municipality's centroid (hardcoded table of 60 Lithuanian municipalities with radius thresholds). Outputs `check_pins_report.txt` sorted by worst offender, with Google Maps links per entry.
- **32 suspicious pins flagged**, manually reviewed by opening each Maps link. 31 confirmed wrong (geocoder resolved ambiguous bare addresses to the wrong city); 1 (Alauša / Laisvės pr. 125A, Vilnius) confirmed correct pin with only a wrong municipality field in LEA source data.
- **`data/stations.json` and `data/geocache.json`** updated with corrected coordinates for all 31 entries; geocache entries marked `source: "manual"`.
- **`data/verifications.json`** extended to 58 entries: the 3 pre-existing manual verifications + 32 check_pins entries + 23 previously manually geocoded addresses from `manual-geocache-addresses.md`.

### Step 22 — "Open in Maps" button in popups

- **Both `index.html` and `dev.html`** — new button in each station popup: red filled button with white pin SVG icon.
  - `index.html`: appears above "Rasti pigesnes netoliese"; visually distinct (solid red vs. outlined blue) so external-link intent is clear without hovering.
  - `dev.html`: appears below Teisinga/Neteisinga buttons; muted style appropriate for dev tooling.
- **Platform-aware URL** (`mapsUrl()` helper, detected once at load):
  - Android → `geo:0,0?q=lat,lng` (opens system maps chooser, drops a pin)
  - iOS → `https://maps.apple.com/?q=lat,lng` (opens Apple Maps app with pin)
  - Desktop → `https://www.google.com/maps?q=lat,lng` (Google Maps web)
- **Label** — "Atidaryti žemėlapyje" on Android/iOS; "Atidaryti Google Maps" on desktop.
- **`color: #ffffff !important`** required to override browser UA stylesheet link color on the `<a>` element.

### Logo fixes (post Step 20)

- **Trevena** — original is a 150×34 px wide banner (4.5:1 ratio); rebuilt circle at 82% width fill on yellow background.
- **Boostpetrol** — mark was only 39% fill; cropped from original JPEG, scaled to 72% fill on navy `(0,55,117)` background.

### Step 23 — Maps link improvement, price tooltips on pins, Pastaba update

- **"Atidaryti žemėlapyje" improved** — `mapsUrl()` now accepts `company`, `address`, `municipality` and builds a business-search URL per platform: Android `geo:lat,lng?q=...`, iOS `maps.apple.com/?q=...&sll=...&z=17`, Desktop `google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...`. Opens business card instead of bare coordinate pin.
- **Price tooltip on every unclustered pin** — permanent Leaflet tooltip above each map pin showing the selected fuel's price (`1.299 €/L`) or `nėra` if unavailable. Adapts to light/dark mode via CSS vars; 2px border (black/white) for contrast. Applies to both cluster markers and cheapest-in-radius result markers.
- **Default fuel type changed to Dyzelinas** — first-time visitors see diesel prices by default (was 95); persisted in localStorage as before.
- **Fuel type selection updates all tooltips** — switching fuel type in the radius panel immediately refreshes all visible pin labels.
- **Pastaba text updated** in the about dialog with corrected geocoding error breakdown.
- **`company-color-review.md`** created — plain list of all 49 companies from `stations.json` for manual color/logo background review.

### Step 24 — Pin color overhaul and dark mode overlay fixes

- **Full `COMPANY_COLORS` rewrite** — all 34 named companies now use brand-accurate hex colors sourced from logo review (`company-color-review.md`). 14 additional companies added that were previously falling through to small-operator grey. GM Circle K entry removed — Circle K franchises now handled entirely by the existing regex.
- **Hue spreading for white-background logos** — companies whose logos have white backgrounds (where the teardrop color is the sole differentiator) had hues slightly spread within each color cluster to improve map readability: oranges, ambers, yellows, and blues each shifted 5–13° apart. Dark greens (Gazimpeksas, Pynauja, Emsi, Jozita) brightened instead of hue-shifted (too dark/desaturated for hue shifts to matter visually), at half the initially computed brightening after visual review.
- **Skulas and Stateta** switched to alt colors: Skulas `#201d1d` (near-black) and Stateta `#f5821f` (orange), avoiding the all-red cluster.
- **Dark mode crosshair marker** — white halo strokes drawn behind the accent-colored lines so the center marker is visible on dark-filtered tiles.
- **Dark mode radius circle** — uses `#60a5fa` (vivid blue) instead of the pale `#89b4fa` accent; weight bumped to 2px; fill opacity 0.10 vs 0.08 in light mode.

### Step 25 — Fuel type selector in toolbar + map center fix

- **Map center corrected** — default `setView` lat moved from `55.913` → `55.2`; first-time visitors now see Lithuania centred without Latvia bleeding into the top of the viewport.
- **Fuel type selector moved to toolbar** — three buttons (`95`, `Dyzelinas`, `Dujos`) added as a persistent row below the search input. On mobile: full-width flex row, each button `flex: 1`. On desktop: buttons are auto-width and share the same row as the search input (`.toolbar-second-row` flex container).
- **`setActiveFuel(type)`** introduced as the single function for all fuel-type changes — updates `activeFuel`, persists to localStorage, syncs button active states, refreshes price tooltips, dispatches `fuelchange` custom event. All prior duplicate sync code (URL restore, panel buttons) replaced with calls to this function.
- **Radius panel decluttered** — fuel type row (`Kuras:` label + pills) removed; reposition pin-drop button removed from panel header (toolbar button already serves this purpose). Panel now shows only radius slider and circle-toggle checkbox.

## Known Issues / Decisions

- **SharePoint layout — check week of 2026-04-14:** ENA switched from direct URLs to SharePoint links (~2026-04-10). Scraping uses `/:x:/` to target Excel files and takes the **first** match — the "Naujausios degalų kainos" banner above the table, which has explicitly pointed to the newest file since day one. The table below it also duplicates the newest link as its last column. Unknown whether next week the page restructures (new table block, banner disappears, etc.) in a way that breaks `matches[0]` = newest. Verify pipeline downloads the correct date on Monday 2026-04-14.
- **xlsx format may change** — parser is flexible on header row position but assumes wide 7-column format.
- **Light/dark mode refinement:** Tile filter applied (Step 15). Popup contrast addressed via CSS variables. Cluster colours unchanged by design.
- **Geocache key normalisation:** Keys are now stripped of surrounding whitespace. If ENA ever changes address strings in the xlsx, affected stations will be re-geocoded automatically on the next pipeline run.
- **Node.js 20 deprecation warning** in the deploy job — caused by `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4` using `actions/upload-artifact@v7` internally. Cannot be fixed from our side; upstream will update before September 2026.
